# ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies
### üîä For taunts
Since native `SoundDuration` doesn't return the proper length of an audio file, you must install the following module:
> https://github.com/yobson1/glua-soundduration

``Note: without it, gamemode is using a static value for taunt rewards.``

### ‚≠ïÔ∏è For Halos
They eat hell a lot of performance, so to make it a bit smoother, we're using a custom outline library:
> https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod/pull/1590/files

``Note: without it, gamemode is using native Garry's Mod halo.``

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This is a rewrite of a gamemode originally created for [a private purpose](https://gmod.waurum.net/).
That being said, the code can:
- be yoinky sometimes as it has been written over time
- contain old parts related to private usage
- not be instinctive for newcomers

I'll do my best to correct that within the next months, but your contributions are welcomed.
